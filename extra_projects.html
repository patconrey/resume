                <p>This app really shows my creativity with naming projects...</p>
                <p>Still a work in progress, this filter-adding application intelligently suggests custom filters
                    based on the image the user wants to edit. For example, an image with people should have different
                    filters than an image of the Grand Canyon.</p>
                <p>By developing this, I learned about the Core Image SDK to create filters and the new Vision API with CoreML to recognize faces and objects.</p>

                <h1>Juke</h1>
                <p>Juke was a fun, small project I made for a friend: she didn't listen to music too much since she liked
                    CDs and was rarely in her car. I got the idea for a music player interface that prominently displays
                    a spinning CD of the album art for the current song.</p>
                <p>This app isn't connected to the internet or a streaming service. It would just come with a preloaded playlist of songs.
                    The code isn't hosted on my GitHub, but if you're interested please feel free to reach out!</p>
                <p>The songs in the mockup are The Revivalists' "Soul Fight" and Travis Scott's "coordinate,"

                <p>This is a project I built for my employer, <a href="http://gamifi.co/" target="_blank">Gamifi</a>.</p>
                <p>Gamification encompasses a broad range of technologies. One particularly compelling technology on the
                    horizon is augmented reality, AR. We wanted to create a way that a client could define landmarks on a
                    map and we can show users those landmarks in the real world.</p>
                <p>Since Gamifi has a number of clients that want to implement this feature, I built it as
                    a modular framework with intuitive data source and delegate protocols so we can easily implement the
                    framework in the future.</p>

                <h1>DanceBlue Content Management</h1>
                <p>DanceBlue is a 24-hour no-sitting, no-sleeping dance marathon that donates its proceeds to The Golden Matrix
                    Fund to benefit kids with pediatric cancer and to further fund research. I've recently (May 2018) become the coordinator
                    for the mobile application.</p>
                <p>The app pulls its data from Firebase. Before I got the position, other coordinators were having to go into
                    the Firebase console and manually enter blog posts. I built a website that enables coordinators to update
                    blog posts through a UI, allowing them to attach images and see a preview of what it would look like on a mobile device.</p>

            <!-- Text Descriptor -->
            <div class="col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-12">
                <p>The website also allows coordinators to see a list of the current posts, saving them time from digging through
                    the JSON tree in the Firebase console. This system has proven effective and instills confidence in the
                    coordinators, who would frequently worry that they would mess up one of the JSON keys.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've got a demo of the site up and running. It doesn't post any of the data you enter. I've found that
                    it's really fun to play with the mobile device preview. Play around with it and send your feedback my way!

                <h1>SGA Constitution</h1>
                <p>I love UK's Student Government Association. I've been a senator and now I'm on the executive board
                    as Director of Technology. I sincerely believe that SGA can benefit students' lives and ensure that their
                    experiences are as equitable as possible. It starts with our bylaws.</p>
                <p>
                    UKSGA has had a pretty awful record at disseminating the most updated version of its constitution, and, when we
                    do, it's a Word document. It's not accessible and it's not readily available. As soon as I was appointed, I built
                    a site to house our Constitution. There's an administrative backend that enables the Operations & Evaluations committee
                    chair to update any Article, Section, Subsection, Clause, or Subclause.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The experience was built with the Symfony framework, and while designing, I paid particular attention to its
                    accessibility so any student, regardless of their background, can easiliy navigate the site and understand SGA's
                    purpose.
