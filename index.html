                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>I'm a student at the University of Kentucky. I'm in my fourth year pursuing two degrees in
                    Electrical Engineering and Mathematics. I've been designing since I was 15 or so and I only recently
                    got into programming (see <a href="#scene">below</a>). Math is my favorite thing in the world with a
                    particular bias towards analysis and topology.
                </p>

                <p>I mainly focus on iOS development with Swift, though I'm more than familiar with PHP,
                Node, and front end web languages like HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript. In fact, I wrote this website
                from scratch and it uses an elementary mix of SCSS for styling, Node for serving, semantic and accessible HTML,
                    jQuery because #jQuery, and Bootstrap for its grid.</p>

                <h1>Mosy</h1>
                <p>Mosy was a blast to program. It started with a personal challenge:
                how fast can I develop a robust chat application? Using Firebase for authentication
                and data storage was huge help. The design was largely inspired by Google's Material
                paradigm.</p>
