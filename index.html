                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>I'm a student at the University of Kentucky in my fourth year pursuing degrees in Electrical
                    Engineering and Mathematics. I've been designing for six years and I only recently got into
                    programming (see <a id="scene-link" href="#scene">below</a> for my first project). Math is my favorite thing,
                    closely followed by munchkin cats, closely followed by emojis.
                </p>
                <p>I mainly focus on iOS development, though I've worked in PHP and the Symfony framework,
                Node, and front end web languages like HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript. I hardly know anything about Android
                development but I'm in the process of learning React Native -- wish me luck!
                </p>
                <p> Below, you'll find some projects I'm proud of. I designed all the interfaces from scratch and then
                    built the applications using Swift 3 and 4. If you want to check out the code for any of the projects,
                    let me know and I can give you access to the GitHub repos.

                    some other information, e.g., profile picture, birthday, etc. They can search for others and start conversations,
                    lock certain conversations with a passcode they choose, send and save images and videos, view them later in
                    custom media players, and update their password and email.</p>

                <p>It all started with a personal challenge: how fast can I develop a robust
                    chat application? <a href="https://firebase.google.com/" target="_blank">Firebase</a> was a huge
                    help, and <a href="https://onesignal.com/" target="_blank">OneSignal</a> beautifully handled push
                    notifications. The design was largely inspired by purple, my favorite color, and Google's Material standard.
                    This was the next big project I worked on after my first app, Scene (see <a href="#scene">below</a>).
                I wanted to focus on the user. At the time, that meant pretty animations and a good color scheme. With research,
                I came to learn about accessibility and developing for all users regardless of their culture, capabilities,
                or background. I learned a ton and refine those lessons every day.</p>

                    example, you're on a trip with your friends and don't want to use up data.</p>

                <p>Still a work in progress, this filter-adding application intelligently suggests custom filters
                based on the image they'd like to edit. For example, an image with people should have different
                filters than an image of the Grand Canyon.</p>
                <p>By developing this, I learned about the Core Image SDK to create filters and the new Vision API with CoreML to recognize faces and objects.</p>

                    a spinning CD of the album art for the current song.</p>

                <p>Scene was a social app that let users in a given city log on and see what was
                    happening around them. They could like and comment on scenes (the name we assigned to event listings).
                    We provided authentication through email, Facebook, and anonymous users. The entire app was built on
                    Firebase and we handled push notifications with OneSignal. Scene was my first dive into programming
                    beyond the python and C++ encountered in the standard Electrical Engineering curriculum. I
                    learned Swift through countless hours of Youtube videos, reading
                    Apple's documentation, and Stack Overflow. It was an ... experience ... to say the least. </p>

                <p>My friend came up with the idea in our sophomore year of college. I designed all of the interfaces over
                    the next few months and we began scouting for a mobile developer. None of them worked out, so I
                    reluctantly decided to program it myself. Before I started learning the language, I sent screenshots of the
                    UI to my friend in Silicon Valley -- the only developer I knew. His advice was simple: "That's
                    ambitious. But doable, definitely doable!" Enduring
                    innumerable crashes, failed features, bad designs, tons of revisions, and full course loads for two
                    degrees, I launched Scene on the App Store in April 2017.</p>
                <p>What started with a simple idea launched me on a pretty awesome journey. Through it, I learned the basics
                of iOS development, team management, project planning, and even talked to angel investors. Since April 2017, I've developed
                and designed all of the projects you see on this site.</p>

                <p>This is a project I built for my employer, <a href="http://gamifi.co/" target="_blank">Gamifi</a>.</p>
                <p>Gamification encompasses a broad range of technologies. One particularly compelling technology on the
                horizon is augmented reality, AR. We wanted to create a way that a client could define landmarks on a
                map and we can show users those landmarks in the real world.</p>
                <p>Since Gamifi has a number of clients that want to implement this feature, I built it as
                a modular framework with intuitive data source and delegate protocols so we can easily implement the
                framework in the future.</p>
