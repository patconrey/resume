                <p>I'm a student at the University of Kentucky, graduating in December of 2018, pursuing dual degrees in Electrical
                    Engineering and Mathematics. I've been designing for a while and started
                    programming a few years ago: <a id="scene-link" href="#scene">see my first project</a>. Math is my favorite thing,
                    closely followed by munchkin cats, closely followed by emojis.

                    I'm focusing on PHP and the Symfony Framework.

                <p>This app was a lot of fun to program and design. Users can create an account with their email, password and
                    some other information, e.g., profile picture, birthday, etc. They can search for others and start conversations,
                    lock certain conversations with a passcode they choose, send and save images and videos, view them later in
                    custom media players, and update their password and email.</p>

                <p>It all started with a personal challenge: how fast can I develop a robust
                    chat application? <a href="https://firebase.google.com/" target="_blank">Firebase</a> was a huge
                    help, and <a href="https://onesignal.com/" target="_blank">OneSignal</a> beautifully handled push
                    notifications. The design was largely inspired by purple, my favorite color, and Google's Material standard.
                    This was the next big project I worked on after my first app, <a href="#scene">Scene</a>.
                I wanted to focus on the user. At the time, that meant pretty animations and a good color scheme. With research,
                I came to learn about accessibility and developing for all users regardless of their culture, capabilities,
                or background. I learned a ton and refine those lessons every day.</p>

                    This app takes building blocks to the AR stage. You can select different materials and build whatever
                    structure you can imagine right in your living room. You can save structures, which triggers the app
                    to construct a custom XML file describing your structure, saving it locally and uploading it to a sever. Ultimately, I want to be able to share structures
                    between users, create fun textures with special properties, and collaboratively build in realtime with a friend.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm curious about the role AR will play in tech over the next couple years. I'm particularly excited about
                    its potential in the context of education. I'd love to chat about this, please drop me a line!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Credit for this structure goes to my girlfriend, an electrical engineer pursuing a Masters degree at UC Berkeley.

                <p>Scene was a social app that let users in a given city log on and see what was
                    happening around them. They could like and comment on scenes (the name we assigned to event listings).
                    We provided authentication through email, Facebook, and anonymous users. The entire app was built on
                    Firebase and we handled push notifications with OneSignal. Scene was my first dive into programming
                    beyond the python and C++ encountered in the standard Electrical Engineering curriculum. I
                    learned Swift through countless hours of Youtube videos, reading
                    Apple's documentation, and Stack Overflow. It was an ... experience ... to say the least. </p>

                <p>My friend came up with the idea in our sophomore year of college. I designed all of the interfaces over
                    the next few months and we began scouting for a mobile developer. None of them worked out, so I
                    decided to program it myself. Before I started learning the language, I sent screenshots of the
                    UI to my friend in Silicon Valley -- the only developer I knew. His advice was simple: "That's
                    ambitious. But doable, definitely doable!" Enduring
                    innumerable crashes, failed features, bad designs, tons of revisions, and full course loads for two
                    degrees, I launched Scene on the App Store in April 2017.</p>
                <p>What started with a simple idea launched me on a pretty awesome journey. Through it, I learned the basics
                of iOS development, team management, project planning, and even talked to angel investors. Since April 2017, I've developed
                and designed all of the projects you see on this site.</p>

                <p>
                    I've gotten into web development and have really come to enjoy building websites. I started with Firebase
                    backends and have turned recently to PHP and the Symfony framework. I've turned what I've learned into
                    tools that make managing student organizations easier.

                <p>I've got a friend who loves Drake. Who doesn't? But my friend <em>really</em> loves Drake. So I thought I'd have some fun.</p>
                <p>We're in a few GroupMe channels together, so I built a GroupMe bot that would post a random Drake quote
                    whenever my friend put anything in the channel. The server was written in Python and quickly spun up on Heroku.</p>
                <p>My friend wanted to fight this bot. He left the channel more than a few times. He had no idea who made it
                    or how to remove the bot from the channel.</p>
                <p>Ultimately, I told him I built the bot and turned it off. Who says programming can't be fun?</p>

                <p>DanceBlue is a 24-hour no-sitting, no-sleeping dance marathon that donates its proceeds to The Golden Matrix
                Fund to benefit kids with pediatric cancer and to further fund research. I've recently (May 2018) become the coordinator
                for the mobile application.</p>
                <p>The app pulls its data from Firebase. Before I got the position, other coordinators were having to go into
                the Firebase console and manually enter blog posts. I built a website that enables coordinators to update
                blog posts through a UI, allowing them to attach images and see a preview of what it would look like on a mobile device.</p>

            <div class="col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-12">
                <p>The website also allows coordinators to see a list of the current posts, saving them time from digging through
                    the JSON tree in the Firebase console. This system has proven effective and instills confidence in the
                    coordinators, who would frequently worry that they would mess up one of the JSON keys.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've got a demo of the site up and running. It doesn't post any of the data you enter. I've found that
                    it's really fun to play with the mobile device preview. Play around with it and send your feedback my way!

                <h1>SGA Constitution</h1>
                <p>I love UK's Student Government Association. I've been a senator and now I'm on the executive board
                as Director of Technology. I sincerely believe that SGA can benefit students' lives and ensure that their
                experiences are as equitable as possible. It starts with our bylaws.</p>
                <p>
                    UKSGA has had a pretty awful record at disseminating the most updated version of its constitution, and, when we
                    do, it's a Word document. It's not accessible and it's not readily available. As soon as I was appointed, I built
                    a site to house our Constitution. There's an administrative backend that enables the Operations & Evaluations committee
                    chair to update any Article, Section, Subsection, Clause, or Subclause.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The experience was built with the Symfony framework, and while designing, I paid particular attention to its
                    accessibility so any student, regardless of their background, can easiliy navigate the site and understand SGA's
                    purpose.
