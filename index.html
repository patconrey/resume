                    I'm an iOS developer, designer, and emoji enthusiast.

                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>I'm a student at the University of Kentucky. I'm in my fourth year pursuing two degrees in
                    Electrical Engineering and Mathematics. I've been designing since I was 15 or so and I only recently
                    got into programming (see <a href="#scene">below</a>). Math is my favorite thing in the world, and I'm
                    a huge fan of emojis.
                </p>
                <p>I mainly focus on iOS development with Swift, though I'm more than familiar with PHP,
                Node, and front end web languages like HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript. In fact, I wrote this website
                from scratch and it uses an elementary mix of SCSS for styling, Node for serving, semantic and accessible
                    HTML, jQuery because #jQuery, and Bootstrap for its grid.</p>

            <div class="col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-12">
                <h1>Mosy</h1>
                <p>Mosy was a blast to program. It started with a personal challenge:
                    how fast can I develop a robust chat application? Using <a href="https://firebase.google.com/" target="_blank">Firebase</a>
                    for authentication and data storage was a huge help, and <a href="https://onesignal.com/" target="_blank">OneSignal</a>
                    beautifully handled push notifications. The design was largely inspired by Google's Material paradigm.</p>

            <div class="col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-12">
                <p>This app is fairly straightforward. Users can create an account with their email and a password with
                some other information, e.g., profile picture, birthday, etc. Users can search for others and start conversations,
                lock certain conversations so somebody would need a password to view the conversation, send images, videos,
                update their password and email, save videos and images and later view them in their gallery through custom
                media players.</p>

                <p>All of the previously described features are built, but there's still work to do before I put it on
                the App Store. I'd like to run a few UX tests on the account creation process and make some narrative based
                onboarding screens.</p>

                <p>This app really shows my creativity with naming projects...</p>
                <p>Still a work in progress, this filter-adding application will intelligently suggest custom filters
                to users based on the image they'd like to edit. For example, an image with people should have different
                filters than an image of the grand canyon.</p>
                <p>I learned all about Core Image and some of the new Vision API and CoreML.</p>

                <h1>Juke</h1>
                <p>Juke was a fun, small project I made for a friend. She didn't listen to music too much since she liked
                CDs and she was rarely in her car. I got the idea for a music player interface that prominently displays
                    a spinning CD of the album art for the song that's playing.</p>
                <p>This app isn't connected to the internet in any way and just came with a preloaded playlist of songs.
                The code isn't hosted on my GitHub, but if you're interested please feel free to reach out!</p>
                <p>The songs in the mockup are The Revivalists' "Soul Fight" and Travis Scott's "coordinate,"

                <p>Cipi will cycle through your contacts and you can set reminders to text the people that pop up. Hope
                you get back in touch with some friends :)</p>

                    My life got flipped-turned upside down
                    And I'd like to take a minute
                    Just sit right there
                    I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air
                    In west Philadelphia born and raised
                    On the playground was where I spent most of my days </p>

                <p> Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool
                    And all shootin some b-ball outside of the school
                    When a couple of guys who were up to no good
                    Started making trouble in my neighborhood
                    I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
                    She said 'You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air'</p>
